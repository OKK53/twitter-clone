# Twitter-Clone

This is a FullStack Twitter Clone project using React, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Prisma, MongoDB and NextAuth.
Developed by following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytkG7RT6SvU&ab_channel=CodeWithAntonio).
For the original repository: https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/twitter-clone.
I learned nextjs, prisma, nextauth and many more from this project. I improved my coding skills. Also, I do not intend to take any credits in this repository. All the application development credits belong to him.
